# Introduction:
This project is focused on designing a robust dashboard to track and analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) related to the bank’s lending operations. The dashboard will offer real-time visibility into essential metrics such as loan applications, funded amounts, repayments, and borrower characteristics. By incorporating advanced data visualizations, the tool will highlight monthly trends, regional activity, and borrower profiles, providing a holistic view of the lending landscape.

The project aims to support the bank's efforts in making informed decisions, optimizing lending strategies, and enhancing overall operational efficiency. Through the careful monitoring of key metrics, the bank will be able to respond proactively to changes in the lending environment and address potential risks or opportunities as they arise. 
The analysis is further enhanced with advanced visualizations and explorations using SQL, Excel, and Tableau.

# Objective:
The primary objectives of this project are to develop a comprehensive, data-driven dashboard that will allow the bank to:

1. **Track Loan Applications**: Measure the total number of loan applications, including Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM) changes, to gain insight into the trends and demands of loan applicants.
2. **Monitor Disbursed Loans**: Calculate and track the total amount of loans funded during a specific period, including MTD funded loans and MoM changes, to understand lending volumes and variations over time.
3. **Assess Loan Repayment**: Track the total amount received from borrowers and analyze MTD and MoM changes to evaluate the bank's cash flow and repayment patterns.
4. **Analyze Financial Health**: Calculate the average interest rate and Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio across all loans, providing a comprehensive look at the cost of lending and the financial stability of borrowers.
5. **Visualize Lending Patterns**: Provide detailed data visualizations, including monthly trends, regional analysis, loan term distributions, and borrower demographics, allowing for better insights into loan activity across different dimensions.
6. **Support Decision-Making**: Enable stakeholders to make data-informed decisions by identifying lending trends, understanding borrower behavior, and recognizing regional disparities in loan applications and funding.
